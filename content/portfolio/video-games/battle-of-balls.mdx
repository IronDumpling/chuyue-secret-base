# Battle of Balls

A game that evolved through three major versions, each pushing the boundaries of different programming languages and platforms.

## Project Evolution

### Version 1: C & ARMv7 (2021) - The Origin
The original implementation was developed in **C** for ARM processors with VGA display output as the ECE243 final project. This version demonstrated low-level programming skills and hardware interaction, earning a full mark in the course.

**Key Features:**
- Direct hardware programming on ARM processor
- VGA display rendering
- Assembly optimization for performance
- Real-time physics simulation

**Technologies:** C, ARMv7 Assembly, VGA Display, ARM Architecture

**Repository:** [C/ARM Version on GitHub](https://github.com/IronDumpling/battle-of-balls)

### Version 2: JavaScript Web (2022) - Going Online
The second iteration brought the game to the web using **JavaScript**, making it accessible to anyone with a browser. This version focused on creating a smooth single-player experience with improved graphics and gameplay.

**Key Features:**
- Browser-based gameplay
- Enhanced visual effects
- Smooth ball physics
- Single-player survival mode

**Technologies:** JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, CSS

### Version 3: Rust Multiplayer (2025) - The Ultimate Version
The latest and most advanced version, **Ball Ball U**, was rebuilt from scratch in **Rust** with multiplayer PvP capabilities. This version explores Rust's memory safety and concurrency features for game development.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time multiplayer PvP gameplay
- Advanced physics engine in Rust
- Optimized networking for low-latency gameplay
- Challenging puzzle mechanics
- Enhanced level design

**Technologies:** Rust, Game Development, Networking, Multiplayer Systems

**Repository:** [Rust Multiplayer Version on GitHub](https://github.com/zlt0518/ECE1724-2025F-Rust-Ball-Ball-U)

## The Journey

This project showcases a unique journey of reimagining the same game concept across three different programming paradigms:
- **Systems Programming** (C/Assembly)
- **Web Development** (JavaScript)
- **Modern Systems Language** (Rust)

Each version taught valuable lessons about performance optimization, language design trade-offs, and platform-specific challenges.

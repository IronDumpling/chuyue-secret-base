# Resonance

A 2D stealth platformer that evolved through iterative development, featuring innovative sound-based resonance mechanics for detecting enemies and navigating environments.

## Project Evolution

### Original Version: Resonance (2023-03)
The initial release introduced the core concept of using sound waves and resonance mechanics for stealth gameplay. This version established the fundamental gameplay loop and demonstrated the viability of sound-based detection mechanics in a 2D platformer.

**Key Features:**
- Sound wave-based enemy detection system
- Stealth platformer gameplay
- Strategic level navigation
- Creative puzzle-solving through resonance mechanics

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, 2D Game Development, Audio System Design

**Repository:** [Resonance Stealth on GitHub](https://github.com/IronDumpling/resonance-stealth)

**🎮 Play Online:** [Resonance Web Version](https://irondumpling.github.io/resonance-stealth/)

### Remastered Edition: Resonance RE (2023-04)
Following player feedback and design insights from the original release, the remastered edition refined the core mechanics and enhanced the overall experience.

**Improvements in RE:**
- **Enhanced Mechanics:** Polished sound wave propagation and detection algorithms
- **Improved Visuals:** Updated graphics, animations, and visual effects
- **Refined Level Design:** Redesigned levels based on player feedback for better pacing
- **Quality of Life:** Added UI improvements and player guidance features
- **Performance Optimization:** Better frame rates and smoother gameplay

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, Iterative Game Design, Player Feedback Integration

# Signal Android

A game project that evolved through multiple iterations, refining survival roguelike mechanics with strategic build systems inspired by genre-defining titles like Vampire Survivors and Backpack Heroes.

## Project Evolution

### Version 1: Over-Clock Survivor (Early Prototype)
The initial prototype explored 3D survival roguelike mechanics with a focus on strategic resource management and wave-based combat. This version introduced the core concept of overclocking mechanics, where players could temporarily boost abilities at increased risk.

**Key Features:**
- 3D survival roguelike gameplay
- Resource management systems
- Wave-based enemy encounters
- Risk-reward overclocking mechanics

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, 3D Game Development

**Repository:** [Over-Clock Survivor on GitHub](https://github.com/IronDumpling/over-clock-survivor)

### Version 2: Signal Tower Survivor (Iteration)
An intermediate version that began incorporating signal-based mechanics into the survival format. This iteration experimented with tower defense elements and signal propagation concepts.

**Key Features:**
- Tower defense mechanics
- Signal-based gameplay elements
- Strategic positioning and planning
- Resource allocation systems

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, Game Mechanics Design

### Version 3: Over-Clock Survivor 3D (Enhanced)
A refined 3D version that combined the overclocking mechanics with improved visuals and gameplay systems. This version represented a significant technical advancement in implementing complex game mechanics.

**Key Features:**
- Enhanced 3D graphics and animations
- Polished overclocking systems
- Advanced enemy AI
- Improved player progression

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, 3D Graphics, AI Systems

**Repository:** [Over-Clock Survivor 3D on GitHub](https://github.com/IronDumpling/over-clock-survivor-3d)

### Version 4: Signal Android (Final - Strategy Build Survival Game)
The culmination of all previous iterations, evolving into a refined strategy build survival game inspired by **Vampire Survivors** and **Backpack Heroes**. This version combines the overclocking mechanics, signal-based systems, and resource management into a cohesive strategic survival experience.

**Key Features:**
- Strategic build and resource management gameplay
- Auto-battler mechanics with player-driven strategic decisions
- Innovative signal processing and propagation systems
- Risk-reward overclocking mechanics
- Progressive difficulty and meta-progression
- Item synergies and build optimization
- Wave-based survival with strategic planning

**Game Design Inspirations:**
- **Vampire Survivors**: Auto-battler mechanics, wave-based survival, build optimization
- **Backpack Heroes**: Strategic inventory management, item synergies, resource allocation

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, Game Systems Design, Strategic Gameplay, Auto-battler Mechanics

## The Design Journey

This project showcases an extensive iterative design process:
1. **Prototype Phase** - Exploring survival roguelike mechanics and overclocking systems
2. **Experimentation Phase** - Testing tower defense, signal propagation, and strategic gameplay
3. **Enhancement Phase** - Refining 3D gameplay, enemy AI, and combat systems
4. **Convergence Phase** - Synthesizing the best mechanics into a strategic build survival experience

The evolution demonstrates a commitment to finding the perfect balance between automated action (auto-battler) and strategic depth (build optimization and resource management), creating engaging moment-to-moment decisions within a survival framework.

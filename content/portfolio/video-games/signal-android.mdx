# Signal Android

A game project that evolved through multiple iterations, refining survival roguelike mechanics with strategic build systems inspired by genre-defining titles like Vampire Survivors and Backpack Heroes.

## Project Evolution

### Version 1: Over-Clock Survivor (Early Prototype)
The initial prototype explored 3D survival roguelike mechanics with a focus on strategic resource management and wave-based combat. This version introduced the core concept of overclocking mechanics, where players could temporarily boost abilities at increased risk.

**Key Features:**
- 3D survival roguelike gameplay
- Resource management systems
- Wave-based enemy encounters
- Risk-reward overclocking mechanics

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, 3D Game Development

**Repository:** [Over-Clock Survivor on GitHub](https://github.com/IronDumpling/over-clock-survivor)

### Version 2: Signal Tower Survivor (Iteration)
An intermediate version that began incorporating signal-based mechanics into the survival format. This iteration experimented with tower defense elements and signal propagation concepts.

**Key Features:**
- Tower defense mechanics
- Signal-based gameplay elements
- Strategic positioning and planning
- Resource allocation systems

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, Game Mechanics Design

### Version 3: Over-Clock Survivor 3D (Enhanced)
A refined 3D version that combined the overclocking mechanics with improved visuals and gameplay systems. This version represented a significant technical advancement in implementing complex game mechanics.

**Key Features:**
- Enhanced 3D graphics and animations
- Polished overclocking systems
- Advanced enemy AI
- Improved player progression

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, 3D Graphics, AI Systems

### Version 4: Signal Android (Final - Strategy Build Survival Game)
The culmination of all previous iterations, evolving into a refined strategy build survival game inspired by **Vampire Survivors** and **Backpack Heroes**. This version combines the overclocking mechanics, signal-based systems, and resource management into a cohesive strategic survival experience.

**Key Features:**
- Strategic build and resource management gameplay
- Auto-battler mechanics with player-driven strategic decisions
- Innovative signal processing and propagation systems
- Risk-reward overclocking mechanics
- Progressive difficulty and meta-progression
- Item synergies and build optimization
- Wave-based survival with strategic planning

**Game Design Inspirations:**
- **Vampire Survivors**: Auto-battler mechanics, wave-based survival, build optimization
- **Backpack Heroes**: Strategic inventory management, item synergies, resource allocation

**Technologies:** Unity, C#, Game Systems Design, Strategic Gameplay, Auto-battler Mechanics

## Exhibition & Recognition

Signal Android has been showcased at major gaming exhibitions in China, receiving widespread acclaim:

- **北京核聚变游戏展 (Beijing Nuclear Fusion Game Expo)** - The game was exhibited and received positive feedback from attendees and industry professionals.
- **腾讯WePlay游戏展 (Tencent WePlay Game Expo)** - Featured at this prominent gaming event, where it garnered enthusiastic responses from players and critics alike.

The game's innovative mechanics and strategic depth resonated well with exhibition visitors, contributing to its growing recognition in the indie game development community.

## The Design Journey

This project showcases an extensive iterative design process:
1. **Prototype Phase** - Exploring survival roguelike mechanics and overclocking systems
2. **Experimentation Phase** - Testing tower defense, signal propagation, and strategic gameplay
3. **Enhancement Phase** - Refining 3D gameplay, enemy AI, and combat systems
4. **Convergence Phase** - Synthesizing the best mechanics into a strategic build survival experience

The evolution demonstrates a commitment to finding the perfect balance between automated action (auto-battler) and strategic depth (build optimization and resource management), creating engaging moment-to-moment decisions within a survival framework.

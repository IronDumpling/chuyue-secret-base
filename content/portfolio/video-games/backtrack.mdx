# Backtrack

A fixed-angle 3D level-based parkour game.

Graduation design project in cooperation with students from China Academy of Art.

In this game, you would play as a person who encountered an unexpected event and had to go into hibernation to preserve your life. After a prolonged period of hibernation, you slowly begin to awaken. Inside your mind, a grand and adventurous parkour journey unfolds.

The game has been exhibited in the CUSGA Fair at Shanghai, China and China Academy of Art at Hangzhou, China.

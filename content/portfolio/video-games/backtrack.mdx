# Backtrack

A fixed-angle 3D level-based parkour game.

Graduation design project in cooperation with students from China Academy of Art.

In this game, you would play as a person who encountered an unexpected event and had to go into hibernation to preserve your life. After a prolonged period of hibernation, you slowly begin to awaken. Inside your mind, a grand and adventurous parkour journey unfolds.

The game has been exhibited in the CUSGA Fair at Shanghai, China and China Academy of Art at Hangzhou, China.

The game was also featured in a live stream by renowned gaming content creator 逍遥散人 (Xiaoyao Sanren), who played the game on stream, bringing it to a wider audience.

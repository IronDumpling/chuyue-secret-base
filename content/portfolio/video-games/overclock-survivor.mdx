# Over-Clock Survivor

A 3D survival roguelike game with unique overclocking mechanics, resource management, and endless waves of enemies.

Developed in Unity, this survival roguelike challenges players to manage resources, strategically upgrade abilities, and survive against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. The game features innovative overclocking gameplay mechanics that allow players to temporarily boost their abilities at the cost of increased risk, creating intense risk-reward decision-making moments.

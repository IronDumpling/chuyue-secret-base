# Easy Go Map

An offline GIS software with global urban map data, featuring A* algorithm navigation and optimized solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem.

Built city maps from scratch using C++. Developed a navigator with A* pathfinding algorithm that provides detailed driving instructions. Applied greedy algorithms, simulated annealing, and multi-threading techniques to tackle the NP-hard Traveling Salesman Problem efficiently, achieving top 15% performance in the class.

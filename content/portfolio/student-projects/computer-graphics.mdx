# Computer Graphics Implementation

I implemented render algorithms such as rasterization, ray-casting, ray-tracing. Simple shader pipeline using OpenGL.

Animation algorithms such as Inverse-Kinematics, mass-spring system.

Geometry algorithms such as AABB bounding box and Catmull-Clark subdivision surface algorithm.

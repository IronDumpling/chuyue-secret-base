# Redis RDMA VMA

Performance optimization of Redis using RDMA and VMA technologies to achieve low-latency, high-throughput data access.

Student research project focused on dramatically improving Redis performance by integrating RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) networking capabilities and VMA (Virtual Memory Accelerator) technologies. This optimization bypasses traditional TCP/IP stack overhead, enabling direct memory-to-memory data transfers for ultra-low latency and high throughput data access patterns.

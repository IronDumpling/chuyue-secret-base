# UDP Socket Text Conference

A multi-user text conference system using UDP socket programming with message broadcasting and real-time user management.

Student networking project implementing a real-time, multi-user text conferencing system in C++ using UDP sockets. The system handles message broadcasting to all connected users, manages user connections and disconnections, and ensures efficient message delivery despite UDP's connectionless nature. Features include room management, user authentication, and message synchronization.

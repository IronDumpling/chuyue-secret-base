# Database Management System

A high-performance database management system implementing advanced data structures including LSM tree, B+ tree, Bloom filter, buffer pool with LRU eviction, and extendable hash table.

Collaborative student project implementing a sophisticated database management system from the ground up using C++. This advanced version features state-of-the-art database components:

- **LSM Tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree)**: Optimized for write-heavy workloads with efficient compaction strategies
- **Bloom Filter**: Probabilistic data structure for fast membership testing
- **B+ Tree**: Balanced tree structure for efficient range queries and indexing
- **Buffer Pool**: Memory management system with LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
- **Extendable Hash Table**: Dynamic hash table that grows efficiently without complete reorganization
- **Query Processing**: SQL query parsing, optimization, and execution
- **Transaction Management**: ACID-compliant transaction support

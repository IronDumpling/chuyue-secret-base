# LLVM Small C Compiler

A complete compiler for a C-like language featuring lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, and LLVM IR code generator with optimization passes.

Comprehensive student compiler project implementing all stages of compilation for a simplified C-like language. The project consists of three main components: an ANTLR4-based semantic analyzer for type checking and validation, an LLVM IR code generator that translates source code into intermediate representation, and an optimizer that applies various optimization passes to improve the generated code.

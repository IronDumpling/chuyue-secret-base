# ClickHouse HE: Distributed Query on Homomorphic Encrypted Database

Research project implementing distributed query processing on homomorphically encrypted data using ClickHouse for privacy-preserving database operations.

This student research project explores advanced cryptographic techniques by implementing distributed query processing capabilities on homomorphically encrypted databases. Built on ClickHouse, the system enables secure, privacy-preserving database operations without decrypting sensitive data, demonstrating practical applications of homomorphic encryption in distributed systems.

# Kernel Modules

Custom Linux kernel module development projects exploring system-level programming, kernel architecture, and operating system internals.

Student projects focused on low-level systems programming, involving the development of custom Linux kernel modules in C. These projects provide hands-on experience with kernel architecture, device drivers, system calls, and other operating system internals, demonstrating deep understanding of how the Linux kernel operates.

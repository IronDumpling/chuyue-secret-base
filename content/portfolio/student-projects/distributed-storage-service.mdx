# Distributed Storage Service

A distributed storage system implementing data replication, consistency protocols, and fault tolerance mechanisms for reliable data storage.

Student project building a robust distributed storage service from scratch using C++. The system features automatic data replication across nodes, implements strong consistency protocols to ensure data integrity, and includes comprehensive fault tolerance mechanisms to maintain availability even when individual nodes fail.

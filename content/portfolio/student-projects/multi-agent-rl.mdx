# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Research project implementing multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for coordinated multi-robot exploration tasks in unknown environments.

This project explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to multi-robot systems, focusing on collaborative exploration strategies. The system enables multiple autonomous agents to work together efficiently, sharing information and coordinating their actions to maximize coverage of unknown environments.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-agent coordination algorithms
- Reinforcement learning-based exploration strategies
- Information sharing and communication protocols
- Scalable architecture for varying numbers of agents
- Simulation and real-world validation

**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, ROS, Gazebo

Developed as part of research work at C-MORE Lab, focusing on improving multi-robot coverage efficiency through advanced machine learning techniques.
